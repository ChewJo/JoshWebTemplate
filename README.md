## Welcome to MadeUp Consullting's New CMS

This project was written in C# using Blazor Server, allowing for unparalleled type safety throughout the project.

For Authenticaiton, we've gone with Supabase. If you are not familiar with Supabase, it is essentially a Firebase alternative, supporting for database support through PostgreSQL, it also provides utility for creating accounts through our project, we don't need to write any of the registering code, we just reference Supabase calls.

For our database like I said, we're using a PostgreSQL database via Supabase, this allows for high level security features such as RSL.
